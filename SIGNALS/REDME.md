### Introduction to Signals

Signals are software interrupts used to handle asynchronous events, such as user input (e.g., pressing Ctrl+C), hardware exceptions (e.g., divide by zero), or software conditions (e.g., a timer expiring). They allow processes to respond to events that occur outside their normal flow of execution.

### Signal Generation and Handling

Signals can be generated by:

Terminal input: For example, pressing Ctrl+C generates SIGINT.
Hardware exceptions: Such as invalid memory access (SIGSEGV).
System calls: Using functions like kill or raise.
Software conditions: For example, SIGALRM is generated when a timer expires.

### Processes can handle signals in three ways:

Ignore the signal (except SIGKILL and SIGSTOP).
Catch the signal using a signal handler.
Use the default action, which may terminate the process or perform other predefined actions.
Kernel Support for Signals

The kernel manages signals by:

Maintaining signal definitions in headers like <signal>.
Delivering signals to processes asynchronously.
Allowing processes to set signal dispositions (e.g., ignore, catch, or default).
Signal Function

The signal function is a simple interface to set signal handlers. Its prototype is:

void (*signal(int signo, void (*func)(int)))(int);

signo: The signal number (e.g., SIGINT).
func: The signal handler function, or constants like SIG_IGN (ignore) or SIG_DFL (default).
Unreliable and Reliable Signals
Unreliable signals: In older UNIX systems, signals could be lost or mishandled, especially during critical code execution.
Reliable signals: Modern systems (e.g., POSIX-compliant) use mechanisms like sigaction to ensure reliable signal handling.
Functions Related to Signals

## kill

The kill function sends a signal to a process or process group. Its prototype is:

int kill(pid_t pid, int signo);

pid: The target process ID.
signo: The signal to send.

## raise

The raise function sends a signal to the calling process. Its prototype is:

int raise(int signo);

### alarm

The alarm function sets a timer to generate SIGALRM after a specified number of seconds. Its prototype is:

unsigned int alarm(unsigned int seconds);

### pause

The pause function suspends the calling process until a signal is caught. Its prototype is:

int pause(void);

### abort

The abort function generates the SIGABRT signal to terminate the process abnormally. Its prototype is:

void abort(void);

### sleep

The sleep function suspends the calling process for a specified number of seconds. Its prototype is:

unsigned int sleep(unsigned int seconds);

To establish bidirectional communication between a sender program and a receiver program using multiple FIFOs (named pipes), you need to create two FIFOs: one for sending data from the sender to the receiver, and another for sending data from the receiver back to the sender.
Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement this in C, including both the sender and receiver programs.
*Step-1*: Create the FIFOs
Before running the programs, create two FIFOs using the mkfifo command in the terminal:

mkfifo fifo_sender_to_receiver
mkfifo fifo_receiver_to_sender

*Step 2*: Write the Sender Program
The sender program writes to fifo_sender_to_receiver and reads from fifo_receiver_to_sender.

*Step 3*: Write the Receiver Program
The receiver program reads from fifo_sender_to_receiver and writes to fifo_receiver_to_sender.


Step 4: Compile and Run
Compile both programs:
```
gcc sender.c -o sender
gcc receiver.c -o receiver
```

Run the programs in separate terminal windows:
```
./receiver
./sender
```

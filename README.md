# Linux Programming and Shell Scripting

1. Write a shell script that accepts a file name, starting and ending line numbers as
arguments and displays all the lines between the given line numbers.
2. Write a shell script that deletes all lines containing a specific word in one or more files
supplied as arguments to it.
3. Write a shell script that displays a list of all files in the current directory to which the
user has read, write and execute permissions.
4. Write a C program to implement 'ls –ls' command.
5. Write a C program which creates a child process and the parent waits for child‘s exit.
6. Write a C program to demonstrate the difference between the fork and vfork system
calls.
7. Write a C program in which main process creates a child process and registers a signal
handler to get the exit status of the child asynchronously.
8. Implement ‗ ls|wc -l -c –w ‘ command using pipe and exec functions.
9. Establish bidirectional communication between sender program and receiver program
using multiple FIFO‘s.
10. Implement SVR based Message Queue IPC mechanism to establish asynchronous
communication between two communicating processes.
11. Implement the following communication model:
a) Process 1 creates a Message Queue resource.
b) Process 2 enacts the server role
c) Process 3 and 4 are clients
d) Process 3 seeks ‗isprime‘ service fromthe server by inserting the payload in
the message queue
e) Process 4 seeks ‗iseven‘ service form the server by inserting the payload in
the message queue
f) Server retrieves the service request from the Message queue and inserts
the reply
g) Intended Client retrieves the response.
13. Implement client/server model using socket API
14. Implement a concurrent server using fork based model while avoiding the zombie state
of the client.
15. Implement a concurrent server model using pthread API
15.Solve the producer consumer problem using pthread API
